                requires a different duration of retention of your data, we will consider the sensitivity of the data, the potential risk and security requirements to settle the duration of retention. When the retention of your data is no longer necessary

            <p> All the personal data collected on our WebApp is intended for StoryDots. However, StoryDots may from time to time be required to disclose your information to other entities for the exclusive purpose of customer relation. When processing orders,
                the data must be transferred to other companies on behalf of StoryDots. In such an extent, to reduce the data risk of loss or damage, StoryDots undertakes to minimize the information disclosed to third parties to what is absolutely necessary
                to achieve the goal pursued. Whatever the circumstances, StoryDots will only transfer your data to other companies in the following specific cases: StoryDots is required to transfer your personal data to a third party in relation to requests
                you have made (payment provider, logistic providers, marketing and advertising service providers for the optimization of your purchasing experience); StoryDots has received your express consent to transfer your data to a third party; StoryDots
                is summoned by a judicial authority to transfer said data to an administrative or judicial authority. In this context, StoryDots requires their service providers (Amazon Web Services) to grant the security of your personal data and comply
                with the regulation. The service providers of StoryDots are not entitled to use your personal data to pursue other purposes than those specified by StoryDots in accordance with its instructions. Within the framework of an order made directly
                with a Retailer that sells its products directly on their ecommerce Website (order sold and sent by the Retailer), the personal data collected will be transferred to this Retailer in order to fulfill its obligations. In this extent, the processing
                of personal data will be subject to the Retailer’s confidentiality policy. Likewise, you may subscribe to the Retailer’s newsletter. The processing of personal data relating to the Retailer’s newsletters will be subject to the Retailer’s confidentiality
